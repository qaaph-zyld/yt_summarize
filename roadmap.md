# YouTube Video Summarizer Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the development process for building a comprehensive YouTube video transcript and summarizer tool. The tool will extract transcripts from YouTube videos, process them, and generate various types of summaries to help users quickly understand video content.
