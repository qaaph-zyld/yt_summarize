## In Progress Items
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and validation - May 3, 2025
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility - May 4, 2025
- [ ] Connect frontend and backend components - May 5, 2025
- [ ] Implement state management - May 6, 2025

## Upcoming Items

- [ ] Optimize performance and reduce loading times - May 10, 2025
- [ ] Implement caching for previously processed videos - May 11, 2025

## Blockers/Issues
- **YouTube API Quota**: Need to implement caching to avoid hitting API limits - Will implement local storage solution
- **Transcript Availability**: Some videos don't have captions - Adding clear error messaging for users

## Feature Status
| Feature | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Video ID Extraction | Complete | High | Working for all YouTube URL formats |
| Transcript Processing | Complete | High | Successfully formats with timestamps |
| Summary Generation | Complete | High | Three summary types implemented |
| Key Point Extraction | Complete | High | Using NLP techniques to identify important points |
| Topic Identification | Complete | Medium | Successfully segments content by topic |
| UI Components | Complete | High | All main components implemented |
| Responsive Design | In Progress | Medium | Desktop layout complete, mobile in progress |
| Export Functionality | Not Started | Low | Planned for Phase 4 |

## Testing Progress
- **Unit Tests**: 0/20 - 0%
- **Integration Tests**: 0/10 - 0%
- **End-to-End Tests**: 0/5 - 0%

## Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: 1.5s vs 1.0s target
- **Processing Speed**: 2.0s vs 1.5s target
- **Resource Usage**: Moderate vs Low target

## Next Steps
1. Complete responsive design implementation
2. Integrate frontend and backend components
3. Implement state management
4. Add copy/share functionality
5. Begin testing implementation

## Additional Notes
The project is progressing well with most core functionality implemented. We've created a set of templates to ensure consistency throughout development and documentation. The next focus will be on integration, enhancing the user experience, and implementing comprehensive testing.
